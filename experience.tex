    \item {Volunteered in a non-profit organization by developing a web application to ease data entry processes. Being the only developer, I had the opportunity to work on the entire Software Development Life Cycle:}
    \item {Gathered user requirements using Domain Storytelling techniques.}
    \item {Developed the software in iterations using Blazor WebAssembly (hosted on Azure Storage) with FluentUI, ASP.NET Core 9 (hosted on Azure Container App), EF Core 9, Azure Cosmos DB, Auth0 (because Azure Entra ID is more complex), ReBAC, MassTransit (to facilitate a little of Modular Monolith), Vertical-Slice Architecture, Minimal API (using Reflection to wire up the endpoints that are located in other files), Dev Containers, and GitHub Actions (Continuous Deployment, Dependabot, Gitleaks), Discriminated Union (using OneOf library). \textasciitilde5kLoC.}
    \item {Piloted the software with a small group of users to identify and address issues.}

  \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
    \item {Loved working with the best tech lead of my life.}
    \item {Developed new features in a microservice architecture, applying knowledge of ASP.NET Core 8, EF Core 8, MassTransit, OAuth 2, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes and Helm.}
    \item {Refactored code to Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA). More info on my opinions in my \href{https://bit.ly/zy-vsa}{blog post}.}
    \item {Re-designed how tests are written, resulting in drastically reduced test runtime and allowing developers to own their tests instead of handing the tests to a test team. More info on the guiding principles in my \href{https://bit.ly/zy-tests}{blog post}.}
    \item {Deep-dived into OAuth 2 and its usage in the existing codebase and proposed mitigations. More info on my learnings in my \href{https://bit.ly/zy-oauth2}{blog post}, also answered StackOverflow questions on \href{https://bit.ly/zy-jwt}{JWT} \& \href{https://bit.ly/zy-pat}{PAT}.}
    \item {Created the team's blog and wrote multiple articles to showcase our work.}
    \item {Presented to the wider team in multiple knowledge sharing sessions.}
    \item {Wrote multiple Request for Comments (RFCs), documentation and guides for internal users.}
    \item {Re-evaluated use of Keycloak as the OAuth 2 Server and compared with the alternative of OpenIddict \& ASP.NET Core Identity.}
    \item {Revamped the format for interviewing candidates to better assess their capabilities and interviewed interns \& candidates for full-time positions.}
    \item {Mentored junior engineers by conducting code reviews and pairing with them for multiple tasks. Also inspired them to do better work, sometimes through hard conversations such as performance and behavior related conversations.}
    \item {Initiated migration of Jenkins CI to GitHub Actions.}
