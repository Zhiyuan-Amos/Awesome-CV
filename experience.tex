      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Designed the codebase for a greenfield project based on Vertical Slice Architecture and developed new product features, applying knowledge of ASP.NET Core 2.1, EF Core 2.1, Mediatr, SignalR and SQL.}
        \item {Identified and implemented Concurrency Control using both Pessimistic \& Optimistic Locks, and Application Security measures such as authentication, authorisation and protection against CSRF and XSS attacks.}
        \item {Provided technical guidance for a team of 4 developers by performing code reviews and suggested improvements and best practices to follow, and guided 2 junior developers on using Design Patterns such as MVVM for a C\# desktop application and Algorithmic Thinking.}
        \item {Simplified inherited legacy Java code substantially, resulting in a net decrease of 4.7kLoC, while fixing bugs and implementing multiple new features.}
        \item {Eliminated manual execution of performance tests for a Java desktop application by writing an automated test script in Python, saving 45 minutes per test execution.}
        \item {Eliminated the need for a team of ~20 programmers to perform repetitive chores such as manual cleaning of multiple cache folders (\textasciitilde10 times a day) by initiating and writing an automated script in PowerShell.}

    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Redesigned the key workflow (performed 60 - 80 times per day per inspector) of the existing mobile application used by inspectors to perform site inspection, thereby reducing the number of steps required to perform this workflow from 8 to 3.}
        \item {Redesigned 2 other workflows, thereby reducing the number of keystrokes required to perform them from 8 to 2 and 7 to 2.}
        \item {Automated the monthly generation of inspection schedule, reducing the amount of time taken to generate the schedule from 1 day to 15 minutes.}
        \item {Gathered User Requirements from scratch and continually verified my prototype with users. This helped me to achieve the above, which will eventually be fully developed by HDB's IT Department.}

As a result, this project demands high standards of code quality, and working on this project taught me how to write quality code, and I became familiar with Software Engineering patterns, Unit Testing, CI, CD and Source Control.}
        \item {Mentored a student under the Google Summer of Code program and guided new contributors by discussing with them on how to improve on the existing code architecture and reviewing their code.}
        \item {Wrote missing unit, integration and system tests, increasing test coverage from 90\% to 92\%.}
