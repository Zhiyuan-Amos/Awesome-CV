    \item {Loved working with my tech lead who empowered me to take initiatives and have a bias for action. Some of these initiatives were adopted and subsequently documented on my blog: \href{https://bit.ly/zy-tests}{Integration Tests}, \href{https://bit.ly/zy-vsa}{Vertical-Slice Architecture}, \href{https://bit.ly/zy-oauth2}{OAuth 2} and answers on StackOverflow on \href{https://bit.ly/zy-jwt}{JSON Web Token (JWT)} \& \href{https://bit.ly/zy-pat}{Personal Access Token}.}
    \item {Collaborated with cross-regional stakeholders in a remote and asynchronous work environment, applying expertise in ASP.NET Core 8, EF Core 8, RabbitMQ with MassTransit, OAuth 2 \& OIDC, GitHub Actions, and Microservices (Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm). Additionally, troubleshot and resolved software defects using OpenTelemetry \& Grafana, while also writing and reviewing multiple design and architecture documents.}
    \item {Proposed short-term security mitigations and long-term architectural redesign regarding the use of OAuth 2 \& OIDC in the existing codebase. Presented findings to an Associate Director and a Principal Engineer.}
    \item {Advocated and piloted initiatives towards code maintainability \& developers' productivity by writing code using Vertical-Slice Architecture. Also re-designed how tests are written, drastically reducing test runtime and enabled developers to write their own tests.}
    \item {Showcased the team's technical achievements by creating a blog, authoring multiple articles to highlight our work, and delivering presentations in various knowledge-sharing sessions.}
    \item {Mentored junior engineers by conducting code \& design reviews and pairing with them for multiple tasks. Also inspired them to do better work, sometimes through hard conversations like performance and behavior related conversations.}
    \item {Re-engineered the format for interviewing candidates and job description to increase the chances of a successful interview.}
