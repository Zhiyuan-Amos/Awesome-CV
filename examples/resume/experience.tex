        \item {Evaluated an existing mobile application that is used by inspectors to carry out site inspection.}
        \item {Gathered User Requirements and frequently tested prototype with users.}
        \item {Redesigned the key workflow (performed 60 - 80 times daily per inspector) of the mobile application, reducing the number of steps required to perform this workflow from 8 to 3. Also redesigned the User Interface to be compatible with this improved workflow.}
        \item {Redesigned existing User Interface, thereby reducing the number of keystrokes required to perform 2 other workflows from 8 to 2 and 7 to 2. Also enhanced existing features, thereby reducing the number of keystrokes required.}
        \item {Suggested new features and designed the corresponding User Interface.}
        \item {Automated the monthly generation of inspection schedule, reducing the amount taken to generate the schedule from 1 day to 15 minutes.}
